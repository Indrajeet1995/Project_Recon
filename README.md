# Project-Recon
Project Recon is a Monitoring tool & Backup that keeps tabs on the slaves that are connected in a network
updates the master with files like log files, passwd, os-release, hosts files and it is updated every minute...by setting this script in Cronatab.
You may wish to receive these files on your Email remotely without even being present at master system.
The Script works as Fire and Forget.
